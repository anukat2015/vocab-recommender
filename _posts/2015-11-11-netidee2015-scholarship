Great news!
The PhD topic that I am working on received a scholarship by [Netidee](https://www.netidee.at/die-netidee-2015/gefoerderte-stipendien-2015/).

The Netidee program is organised by the non-profit Internet Foundation Austria ([IPA](https://www.nic.at/uebernic/firmendaten-impressum/internet-foundation-austria-ipa)), which is part of the Internet Service Providers Austria ([ISPA](https://www.ispa.at)). The program supports theses and projects that promote the Internet through innovative ideas. In this respect, the last 10 years, each year they reward 6 student theses with a scholarship after evaluating the received submissions through the respective call.

The award ceremony took place at a great place in Vienna at the MuseumsQuartier on the 11th of November. It was fantastic spontaneously meeting again with people that I had met in the past in international conferences. Attending the workshop earlier about ideas development to products presented by Dr. Stefan Perkmann Berger from [WhatAVenture](http://www.whataventure.com) was a great add-on in the agenda of the day. Although mainly targeting the project winners, I found it super interesting and useful.
